# TxtToObject
This project show a simple way to transform a text file with some data in a list of objects.

We can see two class, the first is TypeVariable that contain some variables of configuration. The second class, ReadTXT, trasnform a text file in a list of some object, but, for this, the text file must contain match headers with variable name of object that will transform.

We use reflection for this purpose. Fell free to contributor for any improve.
